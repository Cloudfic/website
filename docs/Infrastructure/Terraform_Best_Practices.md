# Terraform Best Practices: Building Scalable and Secure Infrastructure Across Cloud Environments (2025)

## Description/Summary

Terraform is a powerful Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool that enables you to manage cloud resources in a declarative and automated way. This document outlines best practices for using Terraform to build scalable, maintainable, and secure infrastructure across AWS, Azure, and GCP. It covers configuration standards, plan analysis, approvals, workspace management, and variables, adapting the original document to a multi-cloud perspective.

## Goals

-   Establish consistent Terraform configuration standards across all projects, improving maintainability and reducing errors.
-   Automate infrastructure provisioning and management using Terraform.
-   Ensure secure and compliant infrastructure deployments.
-   Promote collaboration and knowledge sharing among infrastructure teams.
-   Leverage Terraform Cloud for centralized state management, collaboration, and governance.

## Pre-POC Generic Questions

-   Which cloud providers are being used (AWS, Azure, GCP)?
-   What is the team's experience with Terraform and other IaC tools?
-   What are the specific infrastructure requirements for the application?
-   What are the security and compliance requirements?
-   What is the budget for infrastructure management?
-   What is the desired level of automation and control?
-   What is the current state of the infrastructure (existing resources, configurations)?

## Scenarios

1.  **Multi-Cloud Web Application:** Deploy a web application across AWS, Azure, and GCP using Terraform, ensuring consistent configuration and security policies.
2.  **Centralized Infrastructure Management:** Manage all cloud resources for an organization using Terraform Cloud, providing a single pane of glass for state management, collaboration, and governance.
3.  **Automated Infrastructure Provisioning:** Automate the creation and configuration of cloud infrastructure using Terraform and CI/CD pipelines, enabling self-service provisioning for development teams.
4.  **Security Compliance:** Implement a secure baseline configuration for all cloud accounts using Terraform, ensuring compliance with industry standards and regulatory requirements.

## Configuration Options

Configuration options vary depending on the chosen cloud provider and the specific resources being deployed. Key considerations include:

-   **Resource Naming Conventions:** Establishing consistent naming conventions for all cloud resources.
-   **Module Structure:** Organizing Terraform code into reusable modules.
-   **Backend Configuration:** Configuring remote state storage and locking (e.g., Terraform Cloud, AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, GCP Cloud Storage).
-   **Provider Configuration:** Configuring the necessary providers for each cloud provider (AWS, Azure, GCP).
-   **Variable Management:** Defining and managing variables for different environments (e.g., dev, staging, prod).
-   **Secrets Management:** Securely storing and managing sensitive information (e.g., API keys, passwords) using Terraform Cloud or cloud-specific secrets management services (AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, GCP Secret Manager).

## Results

The results will vary depending on the specific configuration and the complexity of the infrastructure being managed. Key metrics to track include:

-   Deployment time
-   Consistency of deployments
-   Infrastructure cost
-   Security posture
-   Compliance with regulatory requirements

## Guidelines

*   Use descriptive names that reflect the purpose and function of each resource.
*   Separate resources by purpose into files like `bigquery.tf`, `gcs.tf`, and `vpc.tf`.
*   General configurations and providers are set in `main.tf`.

## Must Do

*   Use a remote backend for state management (e.g., Terraform Cloud, AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, GCP Cloud Storage).
    *   **Why**: Enables collaboration, version control, and security for Terraform state.
*   Organize Terraform code into reusable modules.
    *   **Why**: Promotes code reuse, reduces redundancy, and improves maintainability.
*   Use variables to parameterize Terraform code.
    *   **Why**: Allows for easy customization and configuration of infrastructure.
*   Store sensitive information (e.g., API keys, passwords) securely using Terraform Cloud or cloud-specific secrets management services.
    *   **Why**: Prevents sensitive information from being exposed in the codebase.
*   Implement a plan review and approval process for all infrastructure changes.
    *   **Why**: Ensures that changes are reviewed and approved by qualified personnel before being applied.

## Should Do

*   Use a linter to enforce coding standards and best practices.
    *   **Pros**: Improves code quality and consistency.
    *   **Cons**: Requires setting up and configuring the linter.
*   Implement automated testing for Terraform code.
    *   **Pros**: Ensures that changes are working correctly before being deployed.
    *   **Cons**: Requires writing and maintaining the tests.
*   Use a version control system (e.g., Git) to track changes to the Terraform code.
    *   **Pros**: Enables collaboration, versioning, and rollback capabilities.
    *   **Cons**: Requires familiarity with Git.

## Could Do

*   Use a tool like Terragrunt to manage Terraform configurations for multiple environments.
    *   **Pros**: Simplifies the management of complex infrastructure deployments.
    *   **Cons**: Adds complexity to the Terraform workflow.
*   Use a centralized dashboard to monitor the status of Terraform deployments.
    *   **Pros**: Provides a single view of the infrastructure.
    *   **Cons**: Requires setting up and maintaining the dashboard.

## Won't Do

*   Hardcode values in Terraform code.
    *   **Why**: This makes the code less flexible and harder to maintain.
*   Store sensitive information in the codebase.
    *   **Why**: This creates a security risk and could lead to the compromise of sensitive data.
*   Apply changes without reviewing the Terraform plan.
    *   **Why**: This could lead to unexpected and potentially damaging changes to the infrastructure.
