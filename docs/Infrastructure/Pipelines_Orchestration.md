## Description/Summary

Data pipelines orchestration is a critical component of modern data platforms, enabling the automation, scheduling, and monitoring of complex data workflows. This document outlines best practices for implementing data pipeline orchestration solutions across AWS, Azure, and GCP, focusing on cloud-native services and open-source tools. It describes core concepts and provides guidance on selecting the appropriate orchestration tool based on your specific needs.

## Goals

-   Establish a standardized approach to data pipeline orchestration across different cloud environments.
-   Enable the creation, scheduling, and monitoring of complex data workflows.
-   Ensure data pipeline reliability, scalability, and fault tolerance.
-   Promote collaboration and knowledge sharing among data engineering teams.
-   Leverage cloud-native services and open-source tools for cost-effectiveness and flexibility.

## Pre-POC Generic Questions

-   What are the key data pipelines that need to be orchestrated?
-   What are the dependencies between different data pipelines?
-   What are the scheduling requirements for each data pipeline (e.g., hourly, daily, event-triggered)?
-   What are the data quality requirements and validation rules for each pipeline?
-   What are the monitoring and alerting requirements for data pipeline failures?
-   What is the budget for data pipeline orchestration tools and infrastructure?
-   What is the team's experience with data engineering and workflow orchestration?
-   Which cloud provider(s) are being considered (AWS, Azure, GCP)?

## Scenarios

1.  **Batch Data Processing Pipeline:** Orchestrate a batch data processing pipeline that extracts data from various sources, transforms it, and loads it into a data warehouse.
2.  **Real-Time Data Streaming Pipeline:** Orchestrate a real-time data streaming pipeline that ingests data from a message queue, performs real-time analytics, and publishes the results to a dashboard.
3.  **Machine Learning Pipeline:** Orchestrate a machine learning pipeline that trains a model, evaluates its performance, and deploys it to production.
4.  **Cross-Cloud Data Pipeline:** Orchestrate a data pipeline that spans multiple cloud providers, extracting data from one cloud and loading it into another.

## Configuration Options

Configuration options vary depending on the chosen cloud provider and the specific orchestration tool being used. Key considerations include:

-   **Workflow Definition:** Defining the data pipelines as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) using Python or other supported languages.
-   **Task Configuration:** Configuring the individual tasks within the DAGs, including data sources, transformations, and destinations.
-   **Scheduling:** Setting up schedules for the DAGs to run at specific intervals or trigger them based on events.
-   **Monitoring and Alerting:** Configuring monitoring and alerting to track the status of the DAGs and notify administrators of any failures.
-   **Integration with Cloud Services:** Integrating the orchestration tool with other cloud services, such as data storage, data processing, and data warehousing.

## Results

The results will vary depending on the specific configuration and the complexity of the data pipelines. Key metrics to track include:

-   Data pipeline execution time
