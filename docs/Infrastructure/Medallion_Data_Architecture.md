# Medallion Data Architecture: A Layered Approach to Data Quality and Governance Across Cloud Environments (2025)

## Description/Summary

The Medallion Architecture is a data design pattern used to structure data lakes and data warehouses, emphasizing incremental data quality improvement through distinct layers. This document outlines best practices for implementing the Medallion Architecture across AWS, Azure, and GCP, focusing on strategies for data ingestion, processing, storage, governance, and security within each layer. This multi-cloud approach ensures a consistent and reliable data processing framework regardless of the underlying cloud infrastructure.

## Goals

-   Ensure data lineage and traceability throughout the data lifecycle.
-   Optimize data storage and processing for different use cases within each layer.
-   Enable efficient data access and analysis for data scientists and analysts.
-   Implement robust data governance and security measures across all layers.
-   Leverage cloud-native services for cost-effectiveness and scalability.

## Pre-POC Generic Questions

-   What are the key data sources and their characteristics (volume, velocity, variety)?
-   What are the data quality requirements and validation rules for each data source?
-   What are the data transformation and enrichment requirements?
