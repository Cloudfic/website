## Guidelines

*   Leverage managed database services whenever feasible to minimize the operational overhead.
*   Ensure automated backups and point-in-time recovery for data protection and disaster recovery.
*   Set a well-discussed backup retention strategy in consultation with the client. Default retention period is 1 day on RDS.
*   Utilize read replicas to scale read-heavy workloads and enhance performance.
*   Offload reporting and analytics workloads to read replicas from the primary database.
*   For better availability, durability, and disaster recovery plans, prefer multi-az deployments. Consider cross-region for increased durability.
*   Avoid using databases inside containers due to potential data loss risks.
*   Depending on the use case, deploying a database using a K8s operator can be considered.

## Must Do

*   Utilize managed database services like [RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/) or [Aurora](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/) on AWS, [Azure SQL Database](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/azure-sql/database/) or [Azure Cosmos DB](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/cosmos-db/) on Azure, or [Cloud SQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql) or [Cloud Spanner](https://cloud.google.com/spanner/) on GCP.
    *   **Why**: Managed services significantly reduce the operational load and streamline database management.
*   Ensure automated backups and point-in-time recovery are configured.
    *   **Why**: These are crucial for data protection and disaster recovery.
*   Set a backup retention strategy aligned with client's needs.
    *   **Why**: Different applications and clients have varying data retention requirements.

## Should Do

*   Use read replicas to offload workloads and improve performance.
    *   **Why**: It helps to distribute the load and enhances database responsiveness.
*   Prefer multi-AZ deployments for high availability and durability.
    *   **Why**: Downtime can be costly and multi-AZ deployments help to minimize it.

## Could Do

*   When deciding between different managed database services, consider the customer needs and usage patterns.
    *   **Why**: Different services offer different features and performance characteristics.
    *   **AWS**: RDS provides cost-efficient and resizable capacity, while Aurora offers enhanced scalability and performance features.
    *   **Azure**: Azure SQL Database provides a fully managed SQL Server experience, while Cosmos DB is a globally distributed, multi-model database service.
    *   **GCP**: Cloud SQL offers managed MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server, while Cloud Spanner provides horizontally scalable, strongly consistent database service.
*   Use a K8s operator for database deployment in specific cases, such as when a database requires custom extensions or plugins not available in managed services.
    *   **Why**: K8s operator automates and simplifies database administration.

## Won't Do

*   Avoid deploying databases in containers directly without persistent storage.
    *   **Why**: The ephemeral nature of containers poses a significant risk of data loss.

## Conclusion

Managed services, automated backups, read replicas, and multi-AZ deployments are integral for efficient and secure database operations. Container-based databases are highly discouraged due to their potential risks. Choose the appropriate database service based on application requirements and cloud provider capabilities.
