# Provisioning New Resources: A Step-by-Step Guide Across Cloud Environments (2025)

## Description/Summary

Following a structured process is essential when provisioning new cloud resources. This ensures adherence to best practices, maintenance of security standards, and keeps our infrastructure organized and scalable. This document outlines a step-by-step guide for provisioning new resources across AWS, Azure, and GCP, promoting a consistent and repeatable process.

## Goals

-   Establish a standardized process for provisioning new cloud resources.
-   Ensure adherence to security best practices and compliance requirements.
-   Promote the use of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for managing cloud resources.
-   Encourage the use of Terraform modules for reusability and consistency.
-   Streamline the approval process for new resource deployments.

## Pre-POC Generic Questions

-   Which cloud provider is being targeted (AWS, Azure, GCP)?
-   What is the specific resource being provisioned (e.g., compute instance, storage bucket, database)?
-   What is the purpose of the resource and its intended use case?
-   What are the performance, scalability, and availability requirements for the resource?
-   What are the security and compliance requirements for the resource?
-   What is the team's experience with the cloud provider and Terraform?
-   What is the budget for provisioning and managing the resource?

## Scenarios

1.  **Provisioning a New Compute Instance:** Provision a new compute instance (AWS EC2, Azure Virtual Machine, GCP Compute Engine) with the required specifications, security settings, and networking configuration.
2.  **Creating a Storage Bucket:** Create a new storage bucket (AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, GCP Cloud Storage) with appropriate access controls, encryption, and lifecycle policies.
3.  **Deploying a Database:** Deploy a new database instance (AWS RDS, Azure SQL Database, GCP Cloud SQL) with the required configuration, security settings, and backup policies.
4.  **Setting up a Virtual Network:** Create a new virtual network (AWS VPC, Azure Virtual Network, GCP Virtual Private Cloud) with the necessary subnets, routing rules, and security groups.

## Configuration Options

Configuration options vary depending on the chosen cloud provider and the specific resource being provisioned. Key considerations include:

-   **Resource Type and Size:** Selecting the appropriate resource type and size based on workload requirements.
-   **Location:** Choosing the appropriate region and availability zone for the resource.
-   **Networking:** Configuring network access and security for the resource.
-   **Security:** Implementing appropriate security measures, such as IAM roles, access controls, and encryption.
-   **Monitoring:** Setting up monitoring and alerting to track the health and performance of the resource.
-   **Tagging:** Applying appropriate tags to the resource for cost tracking and management.

## Results

The results will vary depending on the specific configuration and the complexity of the resource being provisioned. Key metrics to track include:

-   Provisioning time
-   Resource cost
-   Security posture
-   Compliance with policies
-   Team efficiency

## Post-POC Generic Questions

-   Was the resource provisioned successfully and configured according to the requirements?
-   What were the key benefits and drawbacks of using this process?
-   Were there any unexpected challenges during the POC?
-   Is there enough information to implement this process in a production environment?
-   How long does it take to provision a new resource using this process?
-   What is the plan for supporting and maintaining the provisioned resource after deployment?

## Lessons Learned

Following a structured process for provisioning new resources is crucial for ensuring consistency, security, and compliance. Using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and Terraform modules can significantly streamline the process and reduce errors.

-   What are the expected running costs?
    -   The cost of running the cloud resources that are provisioned.
-   What should the client plan for in terms of maintenance or upkeep costs?
    -   Ongoing maintenance of the Terraform code, infrastructure updates, and security patching.
-   Are there any supporting costs?
    -   Potential costs for training, consulting, and third-party tools.

## Guidelines

*   Define the Resource: Identify the specific cloud resource needed and understand the use case.
*   Evaluate Existing Solutions: Check the Terraform Public Registry for official modules and internal Terraform Registry for custom solutions.
*   Plan for a Custom Module (if needed): Create a private custom module if neither official nor internal modules meet requirements.

## Must Do

*   Use official Terraform modules from the Terraform Registry whenever possible.
    *   **Why**: Ensures security and reliability, as they are supported by Terraform or the cloud provider.
*   Create a new Terraform Cloud workspace dedicated to the new resource.
    *   **Why**: Provides isolated configurations for safe testing and deployment.
*   Before deployment, run a Terraform plan for the new resource in a test environment to validate configurations.
    *   **Why**: Checks for any policy violations, errors, or unexpected dependencies.

## Should Do

*   Submit the Terraform plan for review to ensure it aligns with architecture standards and security policies.
    *   **Pros**: Ensures adherence to organizational standards.
    *   **Cons**: May introduce delays in the deployment process.
*   Add monitoring and alerting for critical resources to track performance and errors.
    *   **Pros**: Enables proactive detection of issues and ensures resource availability.
    *   **Cons**: Requires configuration and integration with monitoring tools.

## Could Do

*   Automate the entire provisioning process using a CI/CD pipeline.
    *   **Pros**: Streamlines the provisioning process and reduces manual effort.
    *   **Cons**: Requires setting up and maintaining the CI/CD pipeline.

## Won't Do

*   Provision resources manually without using Terraform.
    *   **Why**: This leads to inconsistencies and makes it difficult to manage the infrastructure.
*   Store sensitive information (e.g., API keys, passwords) directly in the Terraform code.
    *   **Why**: This creates a security risk and could lead to the compromise of sensitive data.
