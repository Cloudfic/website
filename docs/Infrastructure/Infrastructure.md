## Guidelines

*   Leverage established cloud providers and provisioning tools for stability and scalability.
*   Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform, adhering to best practices for module usage and development.
*   Keep infrastructure synchronized with IaC definitions to avoid configuration drift and ensure consistency.

## Must Do

*   Utilize industry-standard cloud providers such as AWS, Azure, GCP, or IBM Cloud for reliable infrastructure services.
    *   **Why**: Provides access to a wide range of services and a robust infrastructure.
*   Adopt Terraform for Infrastructure as Code. Treat proprietary modules as legacy, preferring community modules first to leverage collective knowledge and expertise.
    *   **Why**: Enables automation, repeatability, and version control of infrastructure.
*   Avoid hardcoding values in Terraform. Do not expose sensitive credentials or values in Terraform code. Use `vars.tf` for this purpose.
    *   **Why**: Improves security and maintainability.
*   Always store state files remotely in a secure and version-controlled environment. For example, use S3 with versioning enabled and DynamoDB as a lock manager on AWS, Azure Blob Storage with locking, or a GCP Cloud Storage bucket with object versioning.
    *   **Why**: Ensures data integrity and collaboration.
*   Regularly monitor infrastructure drift. Maintain a log or report when infrastructure goes out of sync, and collaborate with the client to address any inconsistencies.
    *   **Why**: Prevents configuration drift and ensures consistency.

## Should Do

*   Use the latest version of Terraform whenever possible to leverage new features and security enhancements.
    *   **Pros**: Access to new features and bug fixes.
    *   **Cons**: Potential compatibility issues with older modules.
*   Follow established naming conventions for readability and consistency, such as using underscores in resource names.
    *   **Pros**: Improves code readability and maintainability.
    *   **Cons**: Requires adherence to a defined standard.
*   Implement a linter via pre-commit and as a PR check to ensure code quality and maintainability.
    *   **Pros**: Enforces code quality and consistency.
    *   **Cons**: Requires setup and configuration.
*   Use Terragrunt for larger infrastructure projects to promote DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) code, reducing redundancy and improving maintainability.
    *   **Pros**: Reduces code duplication and simplifies management of complex infrastructure.
    *   **Cons**: Adds complexity to the Terraform workflow.
*   Consider using Terraform Cloud for IAM, lock management, and infrastructure drift monitoring despite potential limitations such as slow speed and user limit.
    *   **Pros**: Provides centralized management and collaboration features.
    *   **Cons**: May have limitations in terms of performance and user limits.

## Could Do

*   Use Terraform APIs like CDKTF when necessary, but keep in mind that using the vanilla Terraform API is highly preferred due to its standardization and large ecosystem of tools.
    *    **Pros**: Allows you to use familiar programming languages to define infrastructure.
    *   **Cons**: Adds complexity and may not be as mature as the standard Terraform API.
*   Use a GitHub template for the repository to automatically incorporate tools such as tfsec and checkov for Terraform code checks in PRs.
    *   **Pros**: Automates security checks and enforces best practices.
    *   **Cons**: Requires integration with GitHub.
*   Consider using tools like [driftctl](https://driftctl.com/), [fluxcd.io](https://fluxcd.io/blog/2022/09/how-to-gitops-your-terraform/), and [snyk.io](https://snyk.io/blog/tools-infrastructure-drift-detection/) for infrastructure drift detection to automate and streamline the process.
    *   **Pros**: Automates the detection of infrastructure drift and simplifies remediation.
    *   **Cons**: Requires integration with external tools.

## Won't Do

*   Avoid wrapping public modules with our own as it adds unnecessary complexity and technical debt.
    *   **Why**: Increases maintenance overhead and reduces the benefits of using community modules.
*   We should not develop or maintain an abstracted platform, but rather engineer tailored solutions adhering to best practices for each client, respecting their specific needs and constraints.
    *   **Why**: Ensures that solutions are tailored to the specific needs of each client.

## Conclusion

Infrastructure best practices are centered around utilizing established cloud providers, employing Terraform for Infrastructure as Code, and ensuring synchronization of infrastructure with IaC definitions. By adhering to these practices, we can create robust, scalable, and maintainable infrastructure solutions for our clients.
