# Terraform Modules: Streamlining Infrastructure Management Across Cloud Environments (2025)

## Description/Summary

This document outlines best practices for using Terraform modules to manage cloud infrastructure, focusing on strategies applicable across AWS, Azure, and GCP. By leveraging Terraform modules, organizations can reduce the effort required to work with Terraform resources, increase the reliability of their infrastructure, and enhance visibility into the provisioning process. This guide will cover module creation, usage, versioning, and best practices for managing infrastructure as code across multiple cloud providers.

## Goals

-   Reduce the effort required to work with Terraform resources by leveraging pre-built modules.
-   Increase the reliability of Terraform state by following HashiCorp's best practices.
-   Enhance visibility of the provisioning process by adding history and traceability.
-   Promote the use of official provider modules to manage resource versions and enable version tracking.
-   Simplify provisioning by passing and handling only variables instead of manually working on complex resource configurations.
-   Enable consistent and repeatable infrastructure deployments across AWS, Azure, and GCP.

## Pre-POC Generic Questions

-   Which cloud providers are being used (AWS, Azure, GCP)?
-   What are the common infrastructure components that are deployed across different projects?
-   What are the specific requirements for each infrastructure component (e.g., security, performance, scalability)?
-   What is the team's experience with Terraform and module development?
-   What is the desired level of abstraction and customization?
-   What is the budget for infrastructure management and automation?
-   What is the existing Terraform workflow and tooling in place?

## Scenarios

1.  **Deploying a Consistent VPC/Network:** Create a Terraform module for deploying a consistent virtual network (VPC in AWS, Virtual Network in Azure, VPC Network in GCP) with pre-defined subnets, routing rules, and security groups across multiple cloud environments.
2.  **Provisioning a Database Instance:** Create a Terraform module for provisioning a database instance (AWS RDS, Azure SQL Database, GCP Cloud SQL) with standardized configuration, security settings, and backup policies.
3.  **Setting up a Kubernetes Cluster:** Create a Terraform module for deploying a Kubernetes cluster (AWS EKS, Azure AKS, GCP GKE) with pre-configured node pools, networking, and security settings.
4.  **Managing IAM Roles/Identities:** Create a Terraform module for managing IAM roles (AWS IAM Roles, Azure Managed Identities, GCP Service Accounts) with consistent permissions and access policies across different cloud environments.

## Configuration Options

Configuration options vary depending on the chosen cloud provider and the specific resources being deployed. Key considerations include:

-   **Module Structure:** Organizing Terraform code into reusable modules with clear inputs and outputs.
-   **Versioning:** Implementing a versioning scheme for Terraform modules (e.g., semantic versioning).
-   **Testing:** Developing automated tests to validate the functionality and correctness of Terraform modules.
-   **Documentation:** Providing clear and concise documentation for each Terraform module.
-   **Backend Configuration:** Configuring remote state storage and locking (e.g., Terraform Cloud, AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, GCP Cloud Storage).
-   **Provider Configuration:** Specifying the required providers and versions for each Terraform module.

## Results

The results will vary depending on the specific configuration and the complexity of the infrastructure being managed. Key metrics to track include:

-   Reduction in code duplication
-   Improvement in deployment consistency
-   Reduction in deployment time

## Guidelines

*   Use descriptive names that reflect the purpose and function of each resource.
*   Separate resources by purpose into files like `bigquery.tf`, `gcs.tf`, and `vpc.tf`.
*   General configurations and providers are set in `main.tf`.

## Must Do

*   Use a remote backend for state management (e.g., Terraform Cloud, AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, GCP Cloud Storage).
    *   **Why**: Enables collaboration, version control, and security for Terraform state.
*   Organize Terraform code into reusable modules.
    *   **Why**: Promotes code reuse, reduces redundancy, and improves maintainability.
*   Use variables to parameterize Terraform code.
    *   **Why**: Allows for easy customization and configuration of infrastructure.
*   Store sensitive information (e.g., API keys, passwords) securely using Terraform Cloud or cloud-specific secrets management services.
    *   **Why**: Prevents sensitive information from being exposed in the codebase.
*   Implement a plan review and approval process for all infrastructure changes.
    *   **Why**: Ensures that changes are reviewed and approved by qualified personnel before being applied.

## Should Do

*   Use a linter to enforce coding standards and best practices.
    *   **Pros**: Improves code quality and consistency.
    *   **Cons**: Requires setting up and configuring the linter.
*   Implement automated testing for Terraform code.
    *   **Pros**: Ensures that changes are working correctly before being deployed.
    *   **Cons**: Requires writing and maintaining the tests.
*   Use a version control system (e.g., Git) to track changes to the Terraform code.
    *   **Pros**: Enables collaboration, versioning, and rollback capabilities.
    *   **Cons**: Requires familiarity with Git.

## Could Do

*   Use a tool like Terragrunt to manage Terraform configurations for multiple environments.
    *   **Pros**: Simplifies the management of complex infrastructure deployments.
    *   **Cons**: Adds complexity to the Terraform workflow.
*   Use a centralized dashboard to monitor the status of Terraform deployments.
    *   **Pros**: Provides a single view of the infrastructure.
    *   **Cons**: Requires setting up and maintaining the dashboard.

## Won't Do

*   Hardcode values in Terraform code.
    *   **Why**: This makes the code less flexible and harder to maintain.
*   Store sensitive information in the codebase.
    *   **Why**: This creates a security risk and could lead to the compromise of sensitive data.
*   Apply changes without reviewing the Terraform plan.
    *   **Why**: This could lead to unexpected and potentially damaging changes to the infrastructure.
