# Logging, Monitoring, and Trending: Maintaining Application Health and Observability (2025)

This document outlines best practices for logging, monitoring, and trending in cloud environments, focusing on strategies applicable across AWS, Azure, and GCP as of March 22, 2025. Effective strategies are pivotal for maintaining application health and swiftly detecting issues.

## Description/Summary

Efficient logging, monitoring, and trending are essential for maintaining application health and swiftly detecting issues. A combination of Application Performance Management (APM) tools, centralized logging, and end-to-end distributed tracing tools can facilitate this, providing comprehensive observability across your cloud infrastructure.

## Goals

-   Provide guidance on implementing effective logging, monitoring, and trending strategies.
-   Highlight the importance of APM tools for application performance analysis.
-   Discuss the benefits of centralized logging solutions.
-   Explore the use of distributed tracing for understanding request flows.
-   Offer cloud-specific recommendations for logging, monitoring, and trending on AWS, Azure, and GCP.

## Pre-POC Generic Questions

-   What are the key performance indicators (KPIs) for the application?
-   What are the service level objectives (SLOs) for availability and performance?
-   What are the logging requirements for compliance and auditing?

## Guidelines

-   Efficient logging, monitoring, and trending strategies are pivotal to maintain application health and swiftly detect issues. A combination of Application Performance Management (APM) tools, centralized logging, and end-to-end distributed tracing tools can facilitate this.

## Must Do

-   Deploy an APM tool. [ElasticAPM](https://www.elastic.co/apm) serves as a competent initial choice for open-source solutions. If budget is not a constraint, consider using [Datadog APM](https://www.datadoghq.com/product/apm/).
    *   **Why**: Provides detailed insights into application performance and bottlenecks.
-   Implement centralized logging. A combination of [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/), [Grafana](https://grafana.com/), and [Loki](https://grafana.com/oss/loki/) is an efficient, lightweight, open-source, and free option.
    *   **Why**: Enables efficient log analysis and troubleshooting.
-   In an environment without Kubernetes, rely on [Cloudwatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) for most information and use [AWS managed Grafana](https://aws.amazon.com/grafana/) for visualization and dashboards on AWS. For Azure, use [Azure Monitor](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/monitor/) and [Azure Managed Grafana](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/managed-grafana/). For GCP, use [Cloud Monitoring](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring) and [Managed Service for Grafana](https://cloud.google.com/managed-grafana/). It features Slack integration, an alerting system, and is highly expandable/iterable.
    *   **Why**: Provides comprehensive monitoring and alerting capabilities.

## Should Do

*   Other open-source APM alternatives include EFK (Elasticsearch, Fluentd, Kibana) and [SigNoz](https://signoz.io/).
    *   **Pros**: Cost-effective, customizable.
    *   **Cons**: Requires more configuration and maintenance.
*   For centralized logging, consider alternatives like ELK/EFK or Splunk logging if the budget allows.
    *   **Pros**: Powerful log analysis capabilities.
    *   **Cons**: Can be expensive.
*   [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/) can serve both as an APM and centralized logging solution.
    *   **Pros**: All-in-one solution, easy to use.
    *   **Cons**: Can be expensive.
*   Consider end-to-end distributed tracing tools like [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/), [Zipkin](https://zipkin.io/), or [Azure Monitor Application Insights](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/monitor/).
    *   **Pros**: Provides visibility into request flows across microservices.
    *   **Cons**: Requires instrumentation of application code.

## Could Do

*   If the budget allows, [Dynatrace](https://www.dynatrace.com/) is another premium APM option.
    *   **Pros**: Comprehensive monitoring and analysis capabilities.
    *   **Cons**: Very expensive.

## Won't Do

*   Avoid relying solely on the AWS Cloudwatch dashboard, Azure Monitor dashboard, or GCP Cloud Monitoring dashboard as a primary monitoring solution. They are generally considered subpar compared to industry standards like Grafana.
    *   **Why**: Lacks the flexibility and features of dedicated monitoring tools.

## Conclusion

Effective logging, monitoring, and trending are essential for maintaining application health and swiftly detecting issues. A combination of APM tools, centralized logging, and end-to-end distributed tracing tools can facilitate this. Choose the right tools and strategies based on your specific needs and budget, and ensure that you have a plan for ongoing support and maintenance.
