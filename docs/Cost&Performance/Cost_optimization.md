- Kubecost relies on `Prometheus` stack.
  - Kubestate metrics that provide all metrics related to Kubernetes objects (kubestate metrics retrieve those metrics from the Kubernetes API)
  - Node exporter to collect metrics related to the node usage
  - cAdvisors to get metrics related to the containers
  - CoreDNS to get network metrics

- The Kubecost server relies on the cost-analyser pod that includes:
  - A frontend web Ul including Grafana dashboards
  - A Kubecost server to manage all the backend API calls between the various components or clusters
  - And a cost model that provides cost allocation calculation and metrics (the secret sauce of Kubecost)
