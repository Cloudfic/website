# Secure Compute Instance Authorization: IAM Roles in AWS, Azure, and GCP (2025)

This document outlines best practices for managing authorization and access control for compute instances across AWS, Azure, and GCP using their respective identity and access management (IAM) systems as of March 22, 2025. This includes AWS IAM Roles for EC2, Azure's Managed Identities for VMs, and GCP's Service Accounts for Compute Engine.

## Description/Summary

Securely managing access to cloud resources from compute instances is a critical aspect of cloud security. Using IAM roles (or their equivalents) provides a secure and efficient way to grant permissions to instances without embedding long-term credentials in the instance itself. This document explores the key concepts and best practices for implementing this approach across major cloud providers.

## Goals

-   Provide guidance on using IAM roles (or their equivalents) to manage access to cloud resources from compute instances.
-   Explain how to create and associate roles with compute instances in AWS, Azure, and GCP.
-   Highlight the benefits of using temporary security credentials.
-   Emphasize the importance of following the principle of least privilege.
-   Offer cloud-specific recommendations for IAM best practices on AWS, Azure, and GCP.

## Pre-POC Generic Questions

-   What AWS, Azure, and GCP services do the compute instances need to access?
-   What are the specific permissions required for each service?
-   What is the desired level of granularity for access control?
-   What are the compliance and regulatory requirements?
-   What is the existing IAM infrastructure in place?
-   What is the team's experience with IAM and access control?
-   Which cloud provider(s) are being considered (AWS, Azure, GCP)?

## Scenarios

1.  **Web Application Accessing Storage:** A web application running on a compute instance needs to access a storage bucket (AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, or GCP Cloud Storage).
2.  **Data Processing Application Accessing Databases:** A data processing application running on a compute instance needs to access a database service (AWS RDS, Azure SQL Database, or GCP Cloud SQL).
3.  **Monitoring Agent Accessing Monitoring Services:** A monitoring agent running on a compute instance needs to send metrics to a monitoring service (AWS CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, or GCP Cloud Monitoring).

## Configuration Options

Configuration options vary depending on the chosen cloud provider and the specific services being accessed. Key considerations include:

-   **IAM Role Creation:** Creating IAM roles with the necessary permissions.
-   **Trust Relationships:** Configuring trust relationships to allow compute instances to assume the roles.
-   **Policy Design:** Designing IAM policies that follow the principle of least privilege.
-   **Instance Association:** Associating the IAM role with the compute instance during launch or after creation.

## Results

The results will vary depending on the specific configuration and the complexity of the environment. Key metrics to track include:

-   Success rate of API calls from the compute instance
-   Security posture of the environment
-   Ease of management and maintenance

## Post-POC Generic Questions

-   Was the chosen IAM solution able to successfully grant the necessary permissions to the compute instances?
-   What were the key benefits and drawbacks of using this approach?
-   Were there any unexpected challenges during the POC?
-   Is there enough information to implement this solution in a production environment?
-   How long does it take to deploy the solution?
-   What is the plan for supporting and maintaining the solution after production deployment?

## Lessons Learned

Using IAM roles (or their equivalents) is a secure and efficient way to manage access to cloud resources from compute instances. Following the principle of least privilege and using temporary security credentials are crucial for maintaining a strong security posture.

    *   No direct cost implications for scaling IAM roles.

## Training

-   What kind of training will be required for the client's staff?
    *   Cloud IAM training, security best practices, and scripting for automation.

## Guidelines

*   Align the specifics of a DR plan with the client's needs and goals. Gain this understanding as part of the Technical Discovery phase.
*   Understand that the client's goals may necessitate resurrecting their infrastructure in another cloud, location, or zone, impacting the requirements significantly.
*   Keep budget considerations at the forefront when planning DR strategies.
*   Educate clients about the difference between Recovery Point Objective (RPO) and Recovery Time Objective (RTO). RPO refers to how much data they can afford to lose, while RTO is about how long it can take to recover.
*   Differentiate between Business Continuity (BC) and DR. BC involves maintaining essential functions during and after a disaster, while DR focuses on recovering from the disaster. Ensure the DR plan adheres to the requirements established in the BC plan.

## Must Do

    *   **Why**: Provides a secure and efficient way to manage access to cloud resources.
*   Follow the principle of least privilege when assigning permissions.
    *   **Why**: Minimizes the risk of unauthorized access.
*   Use temporary security credentials.
    *   **Why**: Reduces the risk of long-term credential compromise.

## Should Do

    *   **Pros**: Reduces manual errors and ensures consistency.
    *   **Cons**: Requires expertise in IaC tools.
*   Implement regular reviews of IAM policies and roles.
    *   **Pros**: Ensures that permissions remain appropriate and up-to-date.
    *   **Cons**: Requires ongoing effort and resources.

## Could Do

*   Use a centralized identity provider to manage user identities and access across multiple cloud environments.
    *   **Pros**: Simplifies identity management and improves security.
    *   **Cons**: Adds complexity to the infrastructure.

## Won't Do

*   Embed long-term credentials directly in compute instances or application code.
    *   **Why**: Creates a significant security risk.
*   Grant overly permissive access to compute instances.
    *   **Why**: Increases the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches.
