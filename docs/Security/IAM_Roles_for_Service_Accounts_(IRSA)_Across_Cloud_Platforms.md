# Secure Pod Authentication: IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA) Across Cloud Platforms (2025)

This document outlines best practices for securely authenticating pods in Kubernetes clusters using IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA) and its equivalents across AWS, Azure, and GCP as of March 22, 2025. This approach enables fine-grained access control and eliminates the need for long-term credentials within pods.

## Description/Summary

IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA) is a feature in Amazon EKS that allows you to associate an IAM role with a Kubernetes service account. This service account can then provide AWS permissions to the containers in any pod that uses that service account. With this feature, applications can have fine-grained security permissions. This document expands on this concept and provides best practices for achieving secure pod authentication across major cloud providers.

## Goals

-   Explain the concept of IRSA and its benefits for securing Kubernetes workloads.
-   Provide guidance on configuring IRSA and its equivalents on AWS, Azure, and GCP.
-   Emphasize the importance of following the principle of least privilege.
-   Discuss the use of temporary credentials and automated credential rotation.
-   Offer cloud-specific recommendations for pod authentication and access control.

## Pre-POC Generic Questions

-   What AWS, Azure, and GCP services do the pods need to access?
-   What are the specific permissions required for each service?
-   What is the desired level of granularity for access control?
-   What are the compliance and regulatory requirements?
-   What is the existing IAM infrastructure in place?
-   What is the team's experience with Kubernetes and IAM?
-   Which cloud provider(s) are being considered (AWS, Azure, GCP)?

## Scenarios

1.  **Pod Accessing Storage:** A pod needs to access a storage bucket (AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, or GCP Cloud Storage).
2.  **Pod Accessing Databases:** A pod needs to access a database service (AWS RDS, Azure SQL Database, or GCP Cloud SQL).
3.  **Pod Accessing Messaging Services:** A pod needs to send messages to a messaging service (AWS SQS, Azure Service Bus, or GCP Cloud Pub/Sub).

## Configuration Options

Configuration options vary depending on the chosen cloud provider and the specific services being accessed. Key considerations include:

-   **Service Account Creation:** Creating Kubernetes service accounts for each application.
-   **IAM Role Creation:** Creating IAM roles with the necessary permissions.
-   **Trust Relationships:** Configuring trust relationships to allow the service account to assume the IAM role.
-   **Annotation:** Annotating the service account with the IAM role ARN.

## Results

The results will vary depending on the specific configuration and the complexity of the environment. Key metrics to track include:

-   Success rate of API calls from the pod
-   Security posture of the environment
-   Ease of management and maintenance

## Post-POC Generic Questions

-   Was IRSA (or its equivalent) able to successfully grant the necessary permissions to the pods?
-   What were the key benefits and drawbacks of using this approach?
-   Were there any unexpected challenges during the POC?
-   Is there enough information to implement this solution in a production environment?
-   How long does it take to deploy the solution?
-   What is the plan for supporting and maintaining the solution after production deployment?

## Guidelines

*   Align the specifics of a DR plan with the client's needs and goals. Gain this understanding as part of the Technical Discovery phase.
*   Understand that the client's goals may necessitate resurrecting their infrastructure in another cloud, location, or zone, impacting the requirements significantly.
*   Keep budget considerations at the forefront when planning DR strategies.
*   Educate clients about the difference between Recovery Point Objective (RPO) and Recovery Time Objective (RTO). RPO refers to how much data they can afford to lose, while RTO is about how long it can take to recover.
*   Differentiate between Business Continuity (BC) and DR. BC involves maintaining essential functions during and after a disaster, while DR focuses on recovering from the disaster. Ensure the DR plan adheres to the requirements established in the BC plan.

## Must Do
