# Automated Security Scanning: Protecting Codebases Across Cloud Environments (2025)

## Description/Summary

Incorporating automated security scanning into our CI/CD pipeline is crucial for detecting vulnerabilities early in the development lifecycle. Tools like CodeQL, SonarCloud, and Safety work together to provide comprehensive security checks, ensuring that our codebase is regularly assessed for security issues, covering both code quality and dependency vulnerabilities on every pull request and push to the main branch. This document outlines best practices for implementing automated security scanning across cloud environments, focusing on strategies applicable across AWS, Azure, and GCP.

## Goals

-   Establish a consistent security scanning process across all projects, improving the overall security posture.
-   Automate the detection of vulnerabilities in code and dependencies early in the development lifecycle.
-   Ensure that all code changes are reviewed for potential security risks before being merged into the main branch.
-   Reduce the risk of deploying vulnerable code to production.
-   Promote a culture of security awareness and responsibility among developers.

## Pre-POC Generic Questions

-   Which programming languages are primarily used in the project?
-   What are the key security risks associated with these languages and frameworks?
-   What security scanning tools are currently in use (if any)?
-   Are there any existing security policies or guidelines?
-   What is the team's experience with security scanning tools?
-   What is the budget for security scanning implementation and maintenance?
-   What are the compliance and regulatory requirements?
-   Which cloud provider(s) are being considered (AWS, Azure, GCP)?

## Scenarios

1.  **Web Application:** Implement security scanning for a web application using CodeQL, SonarCloud, and Snyk, ensuring that the application code and dependencies are free from known vulnerabilities.
2.  **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Project:** Set up security scanning for a Terraform project using tools like Checkov and tfsec, ensuring that the infrastructure code is secure and compliant with best practices.
3.  **Kubernetes Deployment:** Configure security scanning for a Kubernetes deployment using tools like Kube-bench and Trivy, ensuring that the Kubernetes cluster and its workloads are secure and compliant with security standards.
4.  **Multi-Language Project:** Establish a unified security scanning workflow for a project that includes Python, Go, JavaScript, Terraform, and Kubernetes code.

## Configuration Options

Configuration options vary depending on the chosen tools and languages. Key considerations include:

-   **Tool Selection:** Choosing the appropriate security scanning tools for each language and file type.
