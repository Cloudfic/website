# Contributing to Best Practices Documentation: A Guide for 2025

This document outlines the best practices for contributing to our Best Practices documentation, ensuring consistency, clarity, and value for our team and clients.
## Guidelines

-   Best practices entries are written in Markdown, should have their own file, and should be referenced in the `README.md` file, which also serves as the Table of Contents (TOC).
-   Each document should include all the section headers listed in this template.

## Must Do

-   Follow the guidelines listed above.
    *   **Why**: Ensures consistency and ease of navigation.
-   Issue a Pull Request (PR) for any changes you make to the Best Practices documentation. This allows for review and discussion before merging.
    *   **Why**: Promotes collaboration, ensures quality, and allows for knowledge sharing.
-   Ensure that the document is well-formatted and readable.
    *   **Why**: Improves comprehension and usability for all readers.
-   Use the "Must Do" section to detail essential practices that we almost always implement when providing a solution for a customer.
    *   **Why**: Highlights core practices that are critical for success.
-   Provide a "Why" sub-point for each item in the "Must Do" section. This will help us explain to the customer why we are doing something and give TAMs and engineers talking points for customer conversations.
    *   **Why**: Facilitates clear communication with clients and ensures everyone understands the rationale behind our recommendations.

## Should Do

-   Use the "Should Do" section for practices that we usually implement when providing a solution for a customer and should present a good argument for doing so.
    *   **Why**: Provides a framework for practices that are highly recommended but may not be universally applicable.
-   When creating flow charts that need regular maintenance and changes, use the GitHub Mermaid integration. This will allow us to maintain the flow charts in the Markdown file and avoid managing separate files or generating images. [GitHub Mermaid Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-diagrams)
    *   **Pros**: Simplifies maintenance, keeps documentation up-to-date.
    *   **Cons**: Requires familiarity with Mermaid syntax.

## Could Do

-   Use the "Could Do" section for a list of alternative solutions. The alternatives may address edge cases or provide a different approach to solving the problem.
    *   **Why**: Offers flexibility and caters to diverse client needs.

## Won't Do

-   Use the "Won't Do" section to list practices that we will not implement and explain why.
    *   **Why**: Clearly defines boundaries and prevents the adoption of practices that are not aligned with our standards or client needs.

## Conclusion

This document provides a comprehensive guide for contributing to our Best Practices documentation, ensuring that it remains a valuable resource for our team and clients. By following these guidelines, we can maintain consistency, clarity, and relevance in our documentation.
