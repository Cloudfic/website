# Proof of Concept (POC) Template: Evaluating New Technologies (2025)

This document serves as a template for evaluating new technologies and solutions through Proof of Concept (POC) projects. It provides a structured framework for defining objectives, conducting testing, and assessing the viability of a technology for implementation as of March 22, 2025.

## Description/Summary

Provide a concise description of the technology or solution being investigated and the primary reasons for conducting the POC. This should include the problem it aims to solve and the potential benefits it offers.

## Goals

-   Enumerate the specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals of the POC. These goals should be clearly defined and aligned with the overall objectives of the evaluation.

## Pre-POC Generic Questions

-   Is this POC addressing any specific customer issues or pain points?
-   Are there any specific requirements or constraints for the POC (e.g., budget, timeline, compliance)?
-   Are there alternative solutions or technologies that should be considered?
-   What is the timeframe for completing the POC?
-   What investments are required for the POC (e.g., licenses, hardware, cloud resources, data, personnel time)?

## Scenarios

Describe the specific scenarios or use cases that will be tested during the POC. These scenarios should be representative of real-world applications and should allow for a comprehensive evaluation of the technology's capabilities.

## Results

Provide a detailed account of the outcomes of each scenario, including tangible metrics and qualitative observations. Evaluate whether the POC met its defined goals and identify any areas where the technology performed well or fell short.

## Post-POC Generic Questions

-   Did the POC meet its defined goals and objectives?
-   What are the key strengths and weaknesses of the technology based on the POC results?
-   Are there any additional steps or considerations before offering this technology as a solution to customers?
-   Is there enough information to implement/deploy the solution in a production environment? If not, what additional information is needed?
-   What is the estimated time required to deploy the solution in a production environment?
-   What is the proposed plan for supporting and maintaining the solution after production deployment?

## Lessons Learned

Document any key lessons learned during the POC process, including unexpected challenges, best practices, and recommendations for future evaluations.

## Spin-Offs and Additional Value-Adding Services

Identify any potential spin-off projects or additional value-adding services that could be developed based on the technology being evaluated.

## Costs

-   Are there any licensing costs associated with the technology?
-   What were the initial setup costs for the POC?
-   What are the expected ongoing running costs for the technology in a production environment?
-   What should the client plan for in terms of maintenance and upkeep costs?
-   Are there any other supporting costs (e.g., training, consulting)?

## Ability to Self Maintain

Document the best practices, resources, and skills needed for the client to maintain the solution independently.

## Scalability

-   How does the solution scale to meet increasing demands?
-   What would be the cost implications of scaling the solution, both upward and downward?

## Training

-   What kind of training will be required for the client's staff to effectively use and manage the solution?
-   What would be the cost and time implications of this training?

## Security

-   What security measures are included in the solution?
-   How might the solution impact the client's overall IT security posture?

## Integration

-   How well does the solution integrate with the client's existing systems and infrastructure?

## Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity

-   What provisions are included in the solution for disaster recovery and business continuity?

## Customizability

-   How customizable is the solution to meet the unique needs of the client?
-   What would be the cost and time implications of customization?

## Data Migration

-   If data migration is required, how would this process be managed, and what costs may be associated with it?
-   What are the potential risks involved with data migration, and how can they be mitigated?

## Support and Maintenance Post-Production

-   What is the recommended approach to support and maintain this solution once it's in production?
-   What kind of resources (time, talent, tools) will be needed for ongoing support and maintenance?
-   Are there any best practices or guidelines to follow for supporting and maintaining the solution?
-   What are the expected costs associated with support and maintenance?

## Guidelines

*   This template provides a structured approach to evaluating new technologies.
*   The specific questions and sections may need to be adapted based on the nature of the technology being evaluated.
*   Ensure all stakeholders are involved in the POC process to gather diverse perspectives and insights.

## Must Do

*   Clearly define the goals and objectives of the POC before starting any testing.
    *   **Why**: Provides a clear focus and ensures the evaluation is aligned with business needs.
*   Document all steps, configurations, and results of the POC.
    *   **Why**: Ensures transparency, facilitates knowledge sharing, and provides a basis for future evaluations.
*   Involve relevant stakeholders in the POC process.
    *   **Why**: Gathers diverse perspectives and ensures buy-in from key decision-makers.

## Should Do

*   Use a standardized testing methodology to ensure consistent and reliable results.
    *   **Pros**: Ensures consistency and comparability of results.
    *   **Cons**: May not be flexible enough for all technologies.
*   Compare the technology being evaluated with alternative solutions.
    *   **Pros**: Provides a broader perspective and helps identify the best fit for the client's needs.
    *   **Cons**: Requires additional research and effort.

## Could Do

*   Create a detailed report summarizing the findings of the POC and providing recommendations for next steps.
    *   **Why**: Provides a clear and concise summary of the evaluation for decision-makers.

## Won't Do

*   Make assumptions about the technology's capabilities without thorough testing.
    *   **Why**: Assumptions can lead to inaccurate evaluations and poor decision-making.
*   Ignore potential risks or limitations of the technology.
    *   **Why**: A balanced assessment is crucial for making informed decisions.

## Tools and Technology

*   This template is primarily a documentation framework and does not rely on specific tools or technologies.
*   However, project management tools (e.g., Jira, Asana) may be used to track progress and manage tasks related to the POC.
    *   **Pros**: Facilitates project management and collaboration.
    *   **Cons**: Requires configuration and training.
