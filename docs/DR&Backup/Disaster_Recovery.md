# Disaster Recovery (DR): Ensuring Business Continuity in 2025

Disaster Recovery (DR) focuses on restoring your services and data after an unexpected event or failure. The primary objective is to minimize downtime and prevent data loss, ensuring business continuity. This document outlines key guidelines, best practices, and tools for effective DR planning and implementation as of March 22, 2025.

## Guidelines

*   Align the specifics of a DR plan with the client's needs and goals. Gain this understanding as part of the Technical Discovery phase.
*   Understand that the client's goals may necessitate resurrecting their infrastructure in another cloud, location, or zone, impacting the requirements significantly.
*   Keep budget considerations at the forefront when planning DR strategies.
*   Educate clients about the difference between Recovery Point Objective (RPO) and Recovery Time Objective (RTO). RPO refers to how much data they can afford to lose, while RTO is about how long it can take to recover.
*   Differentiate between Business Continuity (BC) and DR. BC involves maintaining essential functions during and after a disaster, while DR focuses on recovering from the disaster. Ensure the DR plan adheres to the requirements established in the BC plan.

## Must Do

*   Develop an emergency response plan, including a contact list and escalation policy.
    *   **Why**: Ensures a coordinated and timely response to incidents.
*   Regularly provide clients with a report on their current DR capabilities to ensure their expectations align with reality.
    *   **Why**: Manages client expectations and ensures transparency.
*   Test the DR plan consistently to ensure that the RTO can be met.
    *   **Why**: Validates the effectiveness of the DR plan and identifies potential issues.

## Should Do

*   Consider using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for DR for faster recovery and greater consistency. IaC allows you to manage and provision your infrastructure through machine-readable files, which can streamline the recovery process.
    *   **Pros**: Faster recovery, greater consistency, automated provisioning.
    *   **Cons**: Requires expertise in IaC tools, initial setup can be time-consuming.
*   Leverage the DR capabilities of the chosen cloud provider. Cloud providers often offer built-in tools and services that can assist with DR.
    *   **Pros**: Integrated tools, simplified configuration, vendor support.
    *   **Cons**: Vendor lock-in, may not meet all requirements.

## Could Do

*   Consider factors like DNS, routing, zones, and data restoration time when planning for a DR failover event.
    *   **Why**: Comprehensive planning ensures a smooth failover process.

## Won't Do

*   Avoid making assumptions about DR based on the use of certain tools, like Terraform. A successful DR strategy requires a comprehensive plan, not just the ability to spin up infrastructure.
    *   **Why**: A comprehensive plan addresses all aspects of recovery, not just infrastructure provisioning.

## Conclusion

Proper planning for DR is essential to minimize downtime and data loss during a disaster. This involves understanding the client's goals, regularly testing the DR plan, and ensuring the client is aware of their current DR capabilities.

## Tools and Technology

*   [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/): An Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently.
    *   **Pros**: Multi-cloud support, declarative configuration, version control.
    *   **Cons**: Requires expertise in Terraform, can be complex to manage.
*   Cloud Providers' DR Tools: Refer to the documentation of the chosen cloud provider for specific tools and services.
    *   AWS: [AWS Disaster Recovery](https://aws.amazon.com/disaster-recovery/)
        *   **Pros**: Integrated with AWS services, automated recovery.
        *   **Cons**: AWS-specific, can be expensive.
    *   Azure: [Azure Site Recovery](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/site-recovery)
        *   **Pros**: Integrated with Azure services, supports replication to Azure or on-premises.
        *   **Cons**: Azure-specific, can be expensive.
    *   GCP: [Google Cloud Disaster Recovery](https://cloud.google.com/backup-disaster-recovery) and [Disaster Recovery Planning Guide](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/dr-scenarios-planning-guide).
        *   **Pros**: Integrated with Google Cloud services, supports various DR scenarios.
        *   **Cons**: Google Cloud-specific, can be expensive.
