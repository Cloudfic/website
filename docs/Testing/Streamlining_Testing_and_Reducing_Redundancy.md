# Parameterized Unit Tests: Streamlining Testing and Reducing Redundancy (2025)

## Description/Summary

When writing unit tests, it's common to encounter scenarios where you want to test a function with multiple different inputs and verify the corresponding outputs. Writing separate test functions for each input can lead to repetitive code and increased maintenance overhead. Parameterized unit tests provide a way to run the same test logic with different sets of inputs, reducing redundancy and improving test coverage. This document outlines best practices for implementing parameterized unit tests in cloud environments, focusing on strategies applicable across AWS, Azure, and GCP.

## Goals

-   Reduce code duplication in unit tests.
-   Improve test coverage by easily testing a function with multiple inputs.
-   Enhance test readability and maintainability.
-   Promote a more efficient and organized testing workflow.
-   Demonstrate how to use parameterization in popular testing frameworks like pytest and unittest.

## Pre-POC Generic Questions

-   Which programming languages are primarily used in the project?
-   What unit testing frameworks are currently in use (e.g., pytest, unittest, JUnit)?
-   Are there any existing testing standards or guidelines?
-   What is the team's experience with parameterized unit tests?
-   What is the budget for testing infrastructure and tools?
-   How important is comprehensive test coverage to the client?
-   Which cloud provider(s) are being considered (AWS, Azure, GCP)?

## Scenarios

1.  **Validating Input Data:** Test a function that validates input data with a variety of valid and invalid inputs, ensuring that it correctly identifies and handles different cases.
2.  **Testing Mathematical Functions:** Test a mathematical function with a range of inputs, verifying that it produces the correct output for each input.
3.  **Testing API Responses:** Test an API client with different API endpoints and parameters, ensuring that it correctly handles different responses.
4.  **Testing Cloud Resource Creation:** Test a function that creates cloud resources with different configurations, verifying that the resources are created correctly in each case.

## Configuration Options

Configuration options vary depending on the chosen testing framework and the complexity of the tests. Key considerations include:

-   **Testing Framework Selection:** Choosing the appropriate testing framework for the project (e.g., pytest, unittest).
-   **Parameterization Method:** Selecting the appropriate method for parameterizing the tests (e.g., `@pytest.mark.parametrize`, `parameterized.expand`).
-   **Data Source:** Determining the source of the test data (e.g., hardcoded values, CSV files, database queries).
-   **Assertion Method:** Choosing the appropriate method for asserting the expected results (e.g., `assert`, `self.assertEqual`).

## Results

The results will vary depending on the specific configuration and the complexity of the tests. Key metrics to track include:

-   Number of lines of code saved by using parameterized tests
-   Test coverage
-   Test execution time
-   Developer satisfaction

## Guidelines

*   Focus on Transforms: Your core logic usually resides within your DoFn s and composite transforms. These are the primary targets for your unit tests.
*   Direct Runner: Use the DirectRunner for unit tests. It executes your pipeline locally, making tests fast and resource-efficient.
*   Test Cases: Create individual test cases for each DoFn or composite transform.
*   Input and Output: Define clear input data and expected output for each test case.
*   Assertions: Use assertion libraries (like pytest in Python) to verify that the actual output matches your expected output.

## Must Do

*   Use a testing framework that supports parameterization (e.g., pytest, unittest with `parameterized`).
    *   **Why**: Enables writing efficient and maintainable tests.
*   Define clear input data and expected output for each test case.
    *   **Why**: Ensures that the tests are well-defined and easy to understand.
*   Use assertion libraries to verify that the actual output matches the expected output.
    *   **Why**: Provides a clear and concise way to check the results of the tests.

## Should Do

*   Use a data source to store the test data (e.g., CSV file, database).
    *   **Pros**: Makes it easier to manage and update the test data.
    *   **Cons**: Adds complexity to the testing setup.
*   Generate test data automatically.
    *   **Pros**: Reduces the effort required to create test data.
    *   **Cons**: Requires additional code to generate the data.

## Could Do

*   Use a mocking framework to isolate the unit under test.
    *   **Pros**: Makes it easier to test the unit in isolation.
    *   **Cons**: Requires learning how to use the mocking framework.

## Won't Do

*   Write separate test functions for each input.
    *   **Why**: This leads to code duplication and increased maintenance overhead.
*   Use a single test function with a loop to test multiple inputs.
    *   **Why**: This makes it harder to identify the specific test case that failed.
