# Pre-Commit Hooks: Enforcing Code Quality and Security Across Cloud Projects (2025)

## Description/Summary

Pre-commit hooks are our first line of defense, ensuring that only high-quality code is committed to our repository. These hooks, configured to run automatically before each commit, help catch errors early, enforce coding standards, and prevent sensitive information from being committed. This document outlines best practices for setting up and using pre-commit hooks in cloud environments, focusing on strategies applicable across AWS, Azure, and GCP.

## Goals

-   Establish a consistent set of pre-commit hooks across all projects, improving code quality and security.
-   Automate code formatting, linting, and security checks before each commit.
-   Ensure adherence to language-specific style guides (e.g., PEP8 for Python, Google Style Guide for Go).
-   Prevent sensitive information (e.g., private keys, passwords) from being committed to the repository.
-   Promote a culture of code quality and continuous improvement.

## Pre-POC Generic Questions

-   Which programming languages are primarily used in the project?
-   What are the preferred style guides for each language (e.g., PEP8 for Python, Google Style Guide for Go)?
-   What linting and formatting tools are currently in use (if any)?
-   Are there any existing coding standards or guidelines?
-   What security checks are currently in place?
-   What is the team's experience with pre-commit hooks?
-   What is the budget for pre-commit hook implementation and maintenance?
-   How important is automated code quality and security checking to the client?

## Scenarios

1.  **Python Project:** Configure pre-commit hooks for a Python project using Black, Ruff, isort, and pydocstyle, ensuring adherence to PEP8 standards and preventing sensitive information from being committed.
2.  **Terraform Project:** Set up pre-commit hooks for a Terraform project using `terraform fmt` and `terraform validate`, ensuring infrastructure code is properly formatted and valid.
3.  **Kubernetes Project:** Configure pre-commit hooks for a Kubernetes project using `kubeconform` or `kubectl validate`, ensuring Kubernetes manifests are valid and adhere to best practices.
4.  **Multi-Language Project:** Establish a unified pre-commit hook configuration for a project that includes Python, Go, Terraform, and Kubernetes code.

## Configuration Options

Configuration options vary depending on the chosen tools and languages. Key considerations include:

-   **Hook Selection:** Choosing the appropriate hooks for each language and file type.
-   **Tool Configuration:** Configuring each tool with the desired settings and rules.
-   **Repository Configuration:** Setting up the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file in the root of the repository.
-   **Environment Configuration:** Ensuring that all developers have the necessary tools installed and configured.

## Results

The results will vary depending on the specific configuration and the quality of the existing codebase. Key metrics to track include:

-   Number of commits that fail the pre-commit checks
-   Consistency of code style
-   Time spent on code reviews
-   Developer satisfaction

## Post-POC Generic Questions

-   Were the chosen pre-commit hooks able to effectively enforce the desired coding standards and security checks?
-   What were the key benefits and drawbacks of using pre-commit hooks?
-   Were there any unexpected challenges during the POC?
-   Is there enough information to implement this solution in a production environment?
-   How long does it take to deploy the solution?
-   What is the plan for supporting and maintaining the solution after production deployment?

## Guidelines

*   Automate Code Quality: Ensures consistent code style and adherence to standards.
*   Early Error Detection: Catches issues before code is committed.
*   Improved Code Readability: Enforces standard formatting and documentation practices.
*   Enhanced Security: Prevents sensitive information from being committed.

## Must Do

*   Install pre-commit: Ensure that all developers have `pre-commit` installed on their local machines.
    *   **Why**: Enables the use of pre-commit hooks.
*   Create a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file: Define the pre-commit hooks in a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file in the root of the repository.
    *   **Why**: Provides a centralized configuration for the pre-commit hooks.
*   Install the pre-commit hooks: Run `pre-commit install` to install the hooks in the `.git/hooks` directory.
    *   **Why**: Activates the pre-commit hooks.

## Should Do

*   Use a consistent set of pre-commit hooks across all projects.
    *   **Pros**: Ensures a consistent code style and reduces the learning curve for new developers.
    *   **Cons**: Requires coordination and agreement on the set of hooks to use.
*   Keep the pre-commit hooks up-to-date.
    *   **Pros**: Ensures that the hooks are using the latest versions of the tools and that any security vulnerabilities are patched.
    *   **Cons**: Requires regular maintenance and testing.

## Could Do

*   Use a tool like `overcommit` to manage pre-commit hooks for multiple languages.
    *   **Pros**: Simplifies the management of pre-commit hooks for multi-language projects.
    *   **Cons**: Adds a dependency on another tool.

## Won't Do

*   Allow developers to bypass the pre-commit hooks.
    *   **Why**: This undermines the purpose of the pre-commit hooks and allows low-quality code to be committed to the repository.
*   Commit sensitive information to the repository.
    *   **Why**: This creates a security risk and could lead to the compromise of sensitive data.
