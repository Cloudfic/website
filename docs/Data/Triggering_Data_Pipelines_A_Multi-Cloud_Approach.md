    *   Increased costs for additional resources.
    *   Potential cost savings from optimizing resource utilization.

### Training

*   What kind of training will be required for the client's staff?
    *   Training on cloud data services, data pipeline orchestration, and scripting for automation.
*   What would be the cost and time implications of this training?
    *   Varies depending on the existing skill set of the team.

### Security

*   What security measures are included in the solution?
    *   IAM policies, access controls, and encryption.
*   How might the solution impact the client's overall IT security posture?
    *   Improved security through centralized management, access control, and data encryption.

### Integration

*   How well does the solution integrate with the client's existing systems and infrastructure?
    *   The triggering mechanism should be integrated with the client's existing data sources and applications.

### Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity

*   What provisions are included in the solution for disaster recovery and business continuity?
    *   Replication of data and infrastructure across availability zones/regions.

### Customizability

*   How customizable is the solution to meet the unique needs of the client?
    *   The triggering mechanism can be customized to fit the client's specific data sources, processing requirements, and data governance policies.
*   What would be the cost and time implications of customization?
    *   Varies depending on the complexity of the customization.

### Data Migration

*   If data migration is required, how would this process be managed, and what costs may be associated with it?
    *   Data migration may be required when migrating data from on-premises systems to the cloud.
*   What are the potential risks involved with data migration, and how can they be mitigated?
    *   Data loss, downtime, and compatibility issues. Implement robust migration procedures and thoroughly test the migration process.

### Support and Maintenance Post-Production

*   What is the recommended approach to support and maintain this solution once it's in production?
    *   Regular monitoring, patching, upgrades, security audits, and performance tuning.

*   Automate the process of triggering data pipelines whenever possible.
*   Monitor the performance of data pipelines to ensure that they are running efficiently.
*   Implement security measures to protect data pipelines from unauthorized access.

### Must Do

*   Select a data pipeline orchestration tool (e.g., Cloud Composer on GCP, Azure Data Factory on Azure, AWS Step Functions on AWS).
    *   **Why**: Provides a centralized platform for managing and scheduling data pipelines.
*   Implement a mechanism for triggering data pipelines based on events or schedules.
    *   **Why**: Enables automated and timely execution of data pipelines.
*   Monitor the performance of data pipelines to ensure that they are running efficiently.
    *   **Why**: Identifies potential bottlenecks and performance issues.

### Should Do

*   Use a version control system to manage data pipeline code and configurations.
    *   **Pros**: Enables collaboration, versioning, and rollback capabilities.
    *   **Cons**: Requires training and adherence to version control best practices.
*   Implement automated testing for data pipelines.
    *   **Pros**: Ensures data quality and prevents errors.
    *   **Cons**: Requires effort to develop and maintain tests.

### Could Do

*   Use a data catalog to enhance data discoverability and metadata management.
    *   **Pros**: Improves data accessibility and understanding.
    *   **Cons**: Requires implementation and maintenance.

### Won't Do

*   Rely on manual processes for triggering data pipelines.
    *   **Why**: Manual processes are error-prone and inefficient.
*   Ignore the performance of data pipelines.
    *   **Why**: Poor performance can lead to delays and increased costs.
