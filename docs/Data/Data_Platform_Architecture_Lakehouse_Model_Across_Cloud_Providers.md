*   Implement a Lakehouse model for data processing and storage.
*   Provide guidance on data ingestion, processing, and transformation.
*   Ensure data privacy and security.
*   Enable data analysis and insight generation.

### Pre-POC Generic Questions

*   What are the key data sources and their characteristics (e.g., volume, velocity, variety)?
*   What are the data processing requirements (e.g., ETL, ELT)?
*   What are the data governance and compliance requirements?
*   What are the data analysis and reporting needs?
*   What is the budget for the data platform infrastructure?
*   What is the team's expertise with different cloud data services?

    *   Varies depending on the existing skill set of the team.

### Security

*   What security measures are included in the solution?
    *   IAM policies, network security groups, encryption, access controls, and auditing.
*   How might the solution impact the client's overall IT security posture?
    *   Improved security through centralized management, access control, and data encryption.

### Integration

*   How well does the solution integrate with the client's existing systems and infrastructure?
    *   The data platform should be integrated with the client's existing data sources and applications.

### Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity

*   What provisions are included in the solution for disaster recovery and business continuity?
    *   Replication of data and infrastructure across availability zones/regions.

### Customizability

*   How customizable is the solution to meet the unique needs of the client?
    *   The data platform can be customized to fit the client's specific data sources, processing requirements, and data governance policies.
*   What would be the cost and time implications of customization?
    *   Varies depending on the complexity of the customization.

### Data Migration

*   If data migration is required, how would this process be managed, and what costs may be associated with it?
    *   Data migration may be required when migrating data from on-premises systems to the cloud.
*   What are the potential risks involved with data migration, and how can they be mitigated?

*   Use a scalable and reliable data processing engine, such as Apache Beam (Dataflow on GCP, Data Factory on Azure, Glue on AWS).
*   Implement robust data governance and security policies.

### Must Do

*   Choose a cloud provider (AWS, Azure, GCP) and create a data lake storage account (S3, Azure Data Lake Storage, Cloud Storage).
    *   **Why**: Provides a scalable and cost-effective storage solution for raw data.
*   Implement a data ingestion process to extract data from various sources and store it in the raw zone using Python scripts or equivalent tools.
    *   **Why**: Enables the collection of data from diverse sources.
*   Set up a data processing pipeline to transform and cleanse the raw data and store it in the trusted zone using Dataflow (GCP), Azure Data Factory (Azure), or Glue (AWS).
    *   **Why**: Improves data quality and prepares it for analysis.

### Should Do

*   Use a data catalog to enhance data discoverability and metadata management.
    *   **Pros**: Improves data accessibility and understanding.
    *   **Cons**: Requires implementation and maintenance.
*   Implement data quality checks and validation rules at each layer of the data lakehouse.
    *   **Pros**: Ensures data accuracy and consistency.
    *   **Cons**: Requires ongoing effort to define and maintain data quality rules.

### Could Do

*   Use a data mesh approach to decentralize data ownership and governance.
    *   **Pros**: Improves agility and responsiveness to business needs.
    *   **Cons**: Requires strong data governance and coordination.
*   Evaluate alternative orchestration tools such as Prefect or Dagster for more advanced pipeline management.
    *   **Pros**: Enhanced features for workflow management and monitoring.
    *   **Cons**: May require a steeper learning curve.

### Won't Do

*   Store sensitive data in plain text.
    *   **Why**: Increases the risk of data breaches.
*   Grant overly permissive access to data.
    *   **Why**: Increases the risk of unauthorized access and data misuse.
