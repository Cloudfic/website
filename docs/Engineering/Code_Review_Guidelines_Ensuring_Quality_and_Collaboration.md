### Guidelines

*   Before Submitting for Review (For Developers)
    *   Self-Review: Conduct a thorough review of your code using this checklist before submitting it for review.
    *   Ticket Link and Summary: Include a link to the relevant ticket and provide a brief summary of the purpose of the PR. Outline test steps to verify the changes (e.g., "Log in, navigate to X, perform action Y, and confirm result Z").
    *   Purpose Alignment: Ensure your changes align with the ticket's stated purpose and business requirements.
    *   Code Clean-Up: Remove any debug code, commented-out code, and unnecessary files or dependencies.
    *   Documentation Update: Update README files, code comments, and any other related documentation impacted by your changes.
    *   Testing: Write or update unit tests for the new code or changes. Verify that all tests pass successfully and ensure adequate coverage.
    *   Pipeline Checks: Ensure all steps in the pipeline (e.g., linting, security scans, code coverage, and integration tests) pass without errors.
    *   Performance Verification: Confirm that your changes do not introduce regressions or adversely impact application performance.
    *   Security Evaluation: Review your changes for potential security issues or vulnerabilities.
