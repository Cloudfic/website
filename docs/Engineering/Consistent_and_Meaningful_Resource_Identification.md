## Naming Conventions: Consistent and Meaningful Resource Identification (2025)

### Description/Summary

This document outlines naming conventions for cloud resources and database elements to ensure maintainability, scalability, and team collaboration across AWS, Azure, and GCP. Consistent and meaningful naming is crucial for efficient resource management, reduced errors, and simplified automation.

### Goals

*   Establish consistent naming conventions for cloud resources and database elements.
*   Improve the organization and discoverability of resources.
*   Reduce the risk of errors and misconfigurations.
*   Enhance collaboration and communication across teams.

### Pre-POC Generic Questions

*   What are the existing naming conventions (if any)?
*   What are the key resource types that need to be named?
*   What are the different environments (e.g., dev, test, prod)?
*   What are the different applications or projects?
*   What are the security and compliance requirements for naming conventions?
*   Which cloud provider(s) are being considered (AWS, Azure, GCP)?

### Scenarios

1.  Naming cloud resources in a multi-cloud environment.
2.  Naming database tables and columns in a consistent manner.
3.  Automating the enforcement of naming conventions.

### Results

The result should be a well-defined and consistently applied naming convention that improves the organization, discoverability, and manageability of cloud resources and database elements.

### Post-POC Generic Questions

*   Were the naming conventions easy to understand and follow?
*   Did the naming conventions improve the organization and discoverability of resources?
*   Did the naming conventions reduce the risk of errors and misconfigurations?
*   Did the naming conventions enhance team collaboration?
*   How can the naming conventions be further improved?

### Guidelines

*   Consistency: Use a consistent naming scheme across all your projects and resources.
*   Readability: Choose names that are descriptive and easy to understand.
*   Conciseness: Keep names as short as possible while still being informative.
*   Uniqueness: Ensure that resource names are unique within their scope (e.g., within a project or region).
*   Avoid Special Characters: Use only lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens (-). Avoid underscores (_), spaces, and other special characters.
*   Prefixes and Suffixes: Use prefixes and suffixes to indicate the resource type, environment, or purpose.

### Must Do

*   Use a consistent naming scheme across all your projects and resources.
    *   **Why**: Improves organization and discoverability.
*   Choose names that are descriptive and easy to understand.
    *   **Why**: Reduces the risk of errors and misconfigurations.
*   Ensure that resource names are unique within their scope (e.g., within a project or region).
    *   **Why**: Prevents naming conflicts.

### Should Do

*   Keep names as short as possible while still being informative.
    *   **Pros**: Improves readability and reduces typing errors.
