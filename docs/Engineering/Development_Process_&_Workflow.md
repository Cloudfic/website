## Development Process & Workflow: A Multi-Cloud Guide (2025)

### Description/Summary

This document outlines a general guideline for the development process and workflow applicable across various teams and cloud environments (AWS, Azure, GCP). While individual teams may differ slightly according to their needs, they should align overall in meeting the important elements outlined within. The focus is on efficient feature development, effective bug triage, and streamlined fix development.

### Goals

*   Provide a general guideline for the development process.
*   Promote efficient feature development.
*   Establish a clear bug triage and fix development process.
*   Encourage team collaboration and knowledge sharing.
*   Ensure code quality and test coverage.

### Pre-POC Generic Questions

*   What are the team's preferred development methodologies (e.g., Agile, Scrum, Kanban)?
*   What tools are used for project management, code collaboration, and testing?
*   What are the coding standards and conventions for the project?
*   What are the key performance indicators (KPIs) for development velocity and code quality?
*   What are the security and compliance requirements for the application?
*   What is the team's experience with different cloud development practices?
*   Which cloud provider(s) are being considered (AWS, Azure, GCP)?

### Scenarios

1.  Developing a new feature for a cloud-native application.
2.  Triaging and fixing a high-priority bug.
3.  Refactoring existing code to improve performance or maintainability.
4.  Onboarding a new team member to the development process.

### Results

The result should be a streamlined and efficient development process that delivers high-quality code and meets the needs of the business.

### Post-POC Generic Questions

*   Was the development process efficient and effective?
*   Did the bug triage process help to prioritize and resolve issues quickly?
*   Did the code review process improve the quality of the code?
*   Did the team collaboration and knowledge sharing practices work well?
*   How can the development process be further improved?

### Lessons Learned

    *   Training on development methodologies, coding standards, and development tools.
*   What would be the cost and time implications of this training?
    *   Varies depending on the existing skill set of the team.

### Security

*   What security measures are included in the solution?
    *   Security reviews should be part of the development process.
*   How might the solution impact the client's overall IT security posture?
    *   Improved security through the identification and remediation of security vulnerabilities in the code.

### Integration

*   How well does the solution integrate with the client's existing systems and infrastructure?
    *   The development process should be integrated with the client's existing systems and infrastructure.

*   What would be the cost and time implications of customization?
    *   Varies depending on the complexity of the customization.

### Data Migration

*   N/A

### Support and Maintenance Post-Production

*   What is the recommended approach to support and maintain this solution once it's in production?
    *   Regular reviews of the development process, and ongoing training for developers and project managers.
*   What kind of resources (time, talent, tools) will be needed for ongoing support and maintenance?
    *   Skilled developers and project managers.
*   Are there any best practices or guidelines to follow for supporting and maintaining the solution?
    *   Follow industry best practices for software development.
*   What are the expected costs associated with support and maintenance?
    *   Salaries for skilled personnel.

### Guidelines

*   **Feature Development:** Work on sensible sized chunks that are well triaged with clear requirements and a clear focus.
*   **Remain Focused:** Enable developers to fully own components and/or features.
*   **In-depth reviews:** Utilize PR reviews for more than just a thumbs-up to unblock merging.
*   **Bug Triage & Fix Development:** Follow a structured process for bug triage and fix development.

### Must Do

*   Establish a clear and well-documented development process.
    *   **Why**: Provides a framework for efficient and consistent software development.
*   Implement a robust bug triage process to prioritize and resolve issues quickly.
    *   **Why**: Ensures that critical bugs are addressed promptly.
*   Utilize code reviews to improve code quality and knowledge sharing.
    *   **Why**: Catches errors early and promotes collaboration.

### Should Do

*   Encourage developers to fully own components and/or features.
    *   **Pros**: Promotes accountability and ownership.
    *   **Cons**: May require additional training and support.
*   Ensure that all code changes are thoroughly tested before being merged into the main branch.
    *   **Pros**: Reduces the risk of introducing bugs into production.
    *   **Cons**: Requires time and effort to develop and maintain tests.

### Could Do

*   Implement pair programming to improve code quality and knowledge sharing.
    *   **Pros**: Improves code quality and fosters collaboration.
    *   **Cons**: Can be time-consuming.

### Won't Do

*   Allow developers to work in isolation without proper communication and collaboration.
    *   **Why**: Can lead to inconsistencies and errors.
*   Skip testing or code reviews.
    *   **Why**: Increases the risk of introducing bugs and security vulnerabilities.
