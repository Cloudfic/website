# SonarQube Community: A Practical Evaluation

SonarQube is a widely used open-source platform for continuous inspection of code quality. It performs automatic reviews with static analysis to detect bugs, code smells, and security vulnerabilities in numerous programming languages. This document provides a practical evaluation based on real-world deployment and usage.

## Guidelines

- Regularly update the SonarQube server to benefit from the latest features and bug fixes.
- Implement regular database backups to prevent data loss.
- Integrate SonarQube with CI/CD pipelines to automate code quality checks.
- Define and enforce coding standards to ensure consistent code quality.
- Monitor SonarQube's performance and resource usage to ensure optimal operation.

## Must Do

- Deploy SonarQube Server: Deploy a SonarQube server on a suitable infrastructure (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure).
  - **Pros:** Provides a centralized platform for code quality analysis, supports numerous languages.
  - **Cons:** Requires infrastructure to host, can be resource-intensive.
- Integrate with GitHub: Integrate SonarQube with GitHub using a GitHub App and Sonar Scan GitHub Action.
  - **Pros:** Automates code analysis on pull requests, provides feedback directly in GitHub.
  - **Cons:** Requires configuration of GitHub App and Actions.

## Should Do

- Use an External Database: For production environments, use an external database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) for high availability.
  - **Pros:** Improves reliability and scalability, supports high-availability configurations.
  - **Cons:** Adds complexity and cost to the deployment.
- Protect the SonarQube Server: Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to protect the SonarQube server from malicious attacks, especially if exposing the server to the internet.
  - **Pros:** Enhances security, protects against common web exploits.
  - **Cons:** Requires additional configuration and maintenance.

## Could Do

- Integrate with SSO/LDAP: Integrate SonarQube with Single Sign-On (SSO) or LDAP for centralized user authentication and authorization.
  - **Pros:** Simplifies user management, enhances security.
  - **Cons:** Requires configuration and integration with existing identity providers.

## Won't Do

- Expose SonarQube Without Protection: Avoid exposing the SonarQube server to the internet without proper security measures.
  - **Why:** Exposing the server without protection can lead to security vulnerabilities and unauthorized access.

## Costs

- Licensing Costs: No licensing costs are involved for the Community Edition.
- Initial Setup Cost: Approximately $35/month for the infrastructure on AWS (t3.medium instance + load balancer).
- Expected Running Costs: Approximately $35/month for the infrastructure on AWS.
- Maintenance Costs: Potential costs for database maintenance, backups, and server updates.

## Ability to Self Maintain

- The client needs to:
  - Keep snapshots of the EBS volume.
  - Migrate the local database to RDS and set up RDS backups for busy production environments.
  - Update the server regularly to get the latest features and bug fixes (via UI or API).

## Scalability

- Vertical Scaling: Use a bigger instance for the SonarQube server.
- Horizontal Scaling: Use multiple instances behind a load balancer once the database is migrated to RDS.
- Multiple SonarQube Servers: Use multiple SonarQube servers, each for a specific team or project.

## Training

- Training Required: Simple training to use the UI, plus the training to use the GitHub App and Sonar Scan GitHub Action. Consider training on SSO integration, LDAP integration, etc.
- Cost and Time: Depends on the client's needs; can be done in a few hours.

## Security

- Included Measures: Authentication and authorization via the UI, GitHub App, and Sonar Scan GitHub Action. Integration with WAF adds extra security.
- IT Security Posture: If well deployed and configured (with WAF), it will not negatively impact the client's overall IT security posture.

## Integration

- Integration with Existing Systems: Integrates well with GitHub Enterprise or GitLab.

## Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity

- Provisions:
  - Enable snapshots to restore the server from a snapshot.
  - Migrate the database to RDS and enable RDS backups.
  - Set up AWS Backup and store the backups in another region.

## Customizability

- Customizability: SonarQube supports plugins, so it's possible to customize the solution to meet the unique needs of the client, according to the technical requirements.
- Cost and Time: No cost implications for customization; can be done in a few hours.

## Data Migration

- Process: Migrate the database easily. If it's not in RDS, the interface provides a backup option. If it's in RDS, it's possible to take a snapshot and restore it in another region.
- Risks and Mitigation: Risks are related to data loss. It can be mitigated by taking snapshots and restoring them in another region.

## Support and Maintenance Post-Production

- Recommended Approach: Taking snapshots regularly and updating the server regularly to get the latest features and bug fixes.
- Resources Needed: Automate backups from Terraform, setting up AWS Backup or Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager.
- Best Practices: Follow SonarQube's guide to install, support, and maintain the solution.
- Expected Costs: AWS Backup costs around 5 USD/month.
