13.03.02 (Approved)GitHub Repository - Structure and Flow
Purpose
Welcome to our organized and scalable GitHub repository strategy! This structure is designed to simplify development, enhance
collaboration, and ensure each Terraform module is easy to manage and reuse while keeping our core application repository clean.

Goal
Streamline repository management for application and infrastructure code.
Enhance scalability and maintainability by adopting Terraform modules.
Automate CI/CD pipelines for code coverage, linting, security, and Terraform plan validations.
Enable seamless collaboration through a well-defined GitHub Flow strategy.

Problem
Current repository structures lack modularity, causing inconsistencies across projects.
Manual updates for infrastructure and application code are time-consuming and error-prone.
Limited visibility in resource tracking and change history impacts maintainability.
Collaboration challenges due to undefined branching and approval workflows.

Risks
Technical Complexity: Managing multiple repositories and pipelines requires significant initial setup.
Knowledge Transfer: Team members unfamiliar with modular Terraform may face a learning curve.
Approval Dependencies: Terraform Cloud approvals may introduce delays in critical deployments.

Dependencies
GitHub Repository setup for application and infrastructure.
Terraform Cloud for managing workspaces, plans, and approvals.

Access to public and private Terraform module registries.
CI/CD tools integrated with GitHub Actions.
Pre-commit hooks for consistent code quality enforcement.

Requirements
A core application repository ( data-platform ) for code, workflows, and pipelines.
An infrastructure repository ( data-platform-terraform ) for Terraform configurations.
Separate repositories for Terraform modules (e.g., BigQuery, Cloud Storage).
Clear branching strategy with CI/CD integration.
Implementation of Terraform workspaces for environment isolation.

Product Diagrams
Repository directory layouts for data-platform and data-platform-terraform .
Example module repository structure for terraform-google-bigquery .
Flowcharts for CI/CD pipelines, including testing, linting, and Terraform workflows.

Assumptions
Team members will adhere to defined branching and CI/CD practices.
Terraform modules will primarily use public modules from the Terraform Registry, with custom modules where necessary.
Workspace isolation ensures no cross-environment interference.

Out of Scope
Helm-based deployment strategies.
Detailed implementation of specific application services or infrastructure resources outside of Terraform modules.

Technical Approach

Story 1: Repository Setup
Description
Tasks
Task 1.1: Create Repositories
Set up data-platform , data-platform-terraform , and module-specific repositories.
Task 1.2: Configure CI/CD Pipelines
Implement workflows for linting, testing, and Terraform validation.
Task 1.3: Document Standards
Update README files for each repository with usage instructions and standards.
