# Code Quality Tools: A Practical Guide

Code quality is vital for long-term maintainability. High-quality code is readable, efficient, and secure. Code quality tools ensure that the code adheres to certain standards and best practices, automating code review and catching potential issues early.

## Guidelines

- Use a consistent coding style and stick to agreed-upon guidelines and principles.
- Keep Terraform version up-to-date, as each new release often comes with improvements and bug fixes.
- Use named values instead of hardcoded ones to improve code readability and reusability.
- Keep modules and resources small and simple to facilitate understanding and maintenance.
- Comment your code. Explain why certain things are done, especially if they are not straightforward.

## Should Do

- Use SonarQube regularly to identify bugs and code smells. If it's the community edition, make sure to keep the codebase under 100k lines of code.
  - **Pros:** Comprehensive code analysis, identifies bugs, code smells, and security vulnerabilities.
  - **Cons:** Can be resource-intensive, community edition has limitations on codebase size.
- Set up a pre-commit hook to automatically run commitlint, `terraform validate`, Checkov, tfsec and tflint on your Terraform files.
  - **Pros:** Catches errors before they are committed to the code repository, enforces coding standards.
  - **Cons:** Requires initial setup and configuration, can slow down the commit process.
- Configure automated scans with SonarQube, Checkov, tfsec, or other code quality tools in your CI/CD pipeline.
  - **Pros:** Ensures code quality is maintained throughout the development process, automates code quality checks.
  - **Cons:** Requires integration with CI/CD pipeline, can increase build times.
- Run `pre-commit run --all-files` before committing any changes to the code repository.
- Add the pre-commit hook installation instructions to the README file to ensure all developers use it. If it's extensive or not fitting in the README context, create a separate file for it and link it in the README. Make sure to keep it up-to-date and cover all the steps required to install and use the pre-commit hook.

## Could Do

- Find more pre-commit hooks addons to check syntax and formatting for other languages, like Python, Shell script, Javascript, YAML, and JSON. It might be helpful when your code contains Lambda functions or other scripts.
  - **Pros:** Improves code quality for multiple languages, ensures consistency across the project.
  - **Cons:** Requires additional configuration, may increase pre-commit hook execution time.
- Use Terraform public modules, mainly from the most common cloud providers, such as AWS, to abstract away complex configurations and improve code reusability.
  - **Pros:** Abstracts away complex configurations, improves code reusability.
  - **Cons:** Can be limited by the module's feature set, requires careful selection of modules.
- Install Sonarlint in your IDE, as well as, tfsec to get instant feedback on the code quality.
  - **Pros:** Provides instant feedback on code quality, helps catch issues early.
  - **Cons:** Requires installation and configuration of IDE plugins.

## Won't Do

- Do not ignore the warnings and recommendations from code quality tools. They are designed to catch potential issues that could impact the operation and security of your infrastructure.
  - **Why:** Ignoring warnings can lead to operational issues and security vulnerabilities.
- Do not hardcode sensitive data in the Terraform files. Instead, use secure methods to handle sensitive data, like environment variables or Terraform variables.
  - **Why:** Hardcoding sensitive data exposes it to potential security breaches.
- Avoid using the `:latest` tag for Docker images in Terraform. It is better to use specific versions to ensure consistency and prevent unexpected changes.
  - **Why:** Using `:latest` can lead to inconsistent deployments and unexpected changes.
- Avoid using Terraform modules from git repositories directly. If there's no other option, use a specific commit hash instead of a branch name to ensure consistency.
  - **Why:** Using branch names can lead to inconsistent deployments as the branch may change.
- Avoid committing unnecessary files to the code repository. For example, the `.terraform` directory, `.terraform.lock.hcl` file, and `.terraformrc` file should be ignored.
  - **Why:** Committing unnecessary files can clutter the repository and expose sensitive information.
- Avoid committing static private/public key files to the code repository. For example purpose, generate a new key pair on the fly and use it in the Terraform code. This way, you can avoid committing the private key to the code repository. The `hashicorp/tls` provider can be used to generate a new key pair.
  - **Why:** Committing private keys exposes them to potential security breaches.

## Conclusion

Maintaining a high standard of code quality in Terraform not only ensures the reliable operation of your infrastructure but also improves the efficiency of your development process. Leveraging tools like pre-commit hook with tflint, SonarQube, Checkov, tfsec, and `terraform validate` allows you to catch potential issues early and build secure, high-quality infrastructure.

## Tools and Technology
