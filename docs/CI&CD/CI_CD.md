# CI/CD Proven Practices

This document outlines proven practices for implementing Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipelines, based on practical experience in automating tasks, ensuring code quality, and managing Kubernetes manifests effectively. These practices empower teams to focus on innovation and delivery.

## Must Do

- **Implement GitHub Actions for CI/CD:** GitHub Actions is a go-to tool for CI/CD, offering seamless integration with GitHub, an extensive marketplace for reusable actions, and the ability to automate tasks like building containers and managing Kubernetes manifests.
  - **Pros:** Tight integration with GitHub, extensive marketplace, flexible scaling.
  - **Cons:** Can become complex with large workflows, requires familiarity with YAML.
  - **Workflow:**
    ```yaml
    name: CI/CD Pipeline
    on: [push, pull_request]
    jobs:
      build:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - uses: actions/checkout@v4
          - name: Build and Test
            run: ./build_and_test.sh
          - name: Publish Artifact
            run: ./publish_artifact.sh
      deploy:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        needs: build
        steps:
          - name: Deploy to GCP
            uses: google-github-actions/setup-gcloud@v2
            with:
              version: 'latest'
              service_account_key: ${{ secrets.GCP_SA_KEY }}
              project_id: your-gcp-project-id

          - name: Authenticate to Google Cloud
            run: |
              gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file=${{ secrets.GCP_SA_KEY }}
              gcloud config set project your-gcp-project-id
              gcloud container clusters get-credentials your-gke-cluster-name --region your-gcp-region

          - name: Deploy to GKE
            run: |
              kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml
              kubectl apply -f k8s/service.yaml
    ```

- **Secure Your Pipelines:** Add security checks to your CI/CD pipeline using tools like Trivy. It scans for vulnerabilities in both application code and OS packages, keeping your builds secure from day one.
  - **Pros:** Early detection of vulnerabilities, wide language support.
  - **Cons:** May produce false positives, requires regular updates to vulnerability database.
  - **Implementation:** Automate vulnerability scanning with GitHub Actions to ensure every build is secure and reliable. Integrate Google Cloud IAM into your CI/CD pipeline to enforce strict access control across services like BigQuery and Cloud Storage.

- **Automate Data Pipeline Tests:** Ensure that automated tests are part of your CI/CD pipeline before deploying data jobs (e.g., Dataflow pipelines, BigQuery queries, or Composer DAGs). This can include unit tests for Dataflow pipelines or query linting for BigQuery jobs to catch issues before they reach production.
  - **Pros:** Maintains the integrity of data processing workflows, avoids errors that can corrupt datasets or cause failures downstream.
  - **Implementation:** Use pytest for testing Python-based Dataflow and Composer workflows. Lint your SQL queries using SQLFluff to ensure BigQuery jobs are optimized and error-free.

## Should Do

- **Lint Kubernetes Manifests:** Linting is essential to catch errors early. Tools like Kubeval or Kube-linter ensure your Kubernetes manifests are not only valid but follow best practices.
  - **Pros:** Helps maintain consistency and quality across deployments, reducing the chance of deployment errors.
  - **Implementation:** Set up automated linting checks in your GitHub Actions workflow to ensure all manifests are validated before they are merged into the main branch.

- **Validate Kubernetes Manifests:** If your clientâ€™s cloud service doesnâ€™t automatically validate Kubernetes manifests, tools like Pluto and kubent are your best friends. These tools help identify deprecated API versions, ensuring that your manifests remain compatible with your Kubernetes version.
  - **Pros:** Catches issues before deployment, saving you from surprises in production.
  - **Implementation:** Incorporate these tools in your CI pipeline to catch any issues before deployment.

- **Monitor and Track Data Pipelines:** Use Cloud Monitoring and Cloud Logging to track the performance and health of your data pipelines. For example, set up monitoring alerts in GitHub Actions for when a Dataflow job fails or when Composer DAGs exceed a certain runtime.
  - **Pros:** Provides visibility into the health and performance of your data pipelines, enabling proactive issue resolution.
  - **Implementation:** Set up monitoring alerts in GitHub Actions for when a Dataflow job fails or when Composer DAGs exceed a certain runtime.

## Won't Do

- **Avoid Insecure or Deprecated CI/CD Tools:** Avoid using CI/CD tools that have known security vulnerabilities, are deprecated, or have a high maintenance overhead.
  - **Why:** Using such tools can compromise the security and stability of your pipelines.
