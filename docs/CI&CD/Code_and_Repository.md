# Code and Repository Management: Practical Guide

Effective code and repository management is the backbone of high-quality, maintainable, and scalable codebases. These practices, based on real-world experience, ensure consistency, smooth collaboration, security, and robust delivery.

## Guidelines

- **Adhere to Conventional Commits:** Use conventional commits for clear and concise commit messages, maintaining a clear history of code changes.
- **Leverage GitHub:** Utilize GitHub for development workflow and release management, taking advantage of its robust features for code management and collaboration.
- **Keep Pull Requests Lightweight:** Ensure pull requests (PRs) are lightweight and linked to GitHub issues to streamline review processes.

## Must Do

- **Conventional Commits for Clear History:** Adhere to the Conventional Commits format when writing commit messages. This standardized approach keeps the history clean and helps in generating changelogs and releases automatically.
  - **Example:** `feat(dataflow): add streaming support to pipeline` or `fix(composer): resolve scheduler bug for hourly DAGs`.
- **Leverage GitHub for Development Workflow:** GitHub is our primary platform for managing development, collaboration, and releases. Use features like Pull Requests (PRs), Issues, and Actions to automate workflows and enforce CI/CD pipelines.
  - **Best Practice:** Keep PRs lightweight, focused on solving specific issues, and always link them to GitHub Issues. This simplifies reviews and keeps everything well-documented.
- **Automate Issue Tracking and Link PRs to Issues on Jira:** Every PR should be linked to a corresponding issue. This creates transparency and helps track progress effectively. Include detailed documentation or references in the issue to provide context for the team.

## Should Do

- **Implement a Code Review Process:** Ensure PRs are reviewed and approved by at least one other team member before merging to improve code quality.
  - **Pros:** Improves code quality, reduces bug introduction risk.
  - **Cons:** Can slow down the development process if not managed efficiently.
- **Use Automated Testing Tools and Continuous Integration:** Run tests whenever changes are pushed to the repository to reduce bug introduction risk.
  - **Pros:** Reduces bug introduction risk, ensures code stability.
  - **Cons:** Requires setup and maintenance of testing infrastructure.

## Could Do

- **Consider Using a Code Linter:** Enforce a consistent coding style across the project, improving readability and maintainability.
  - **Pros:** Improves code readability and maintainability, reduces inconsistencies.
  - **Cons:** Can be time-consuming to set up and configure, may require adjustments to existing code.

## Won't Do

- **Avoid Committing Sensitive Information:** Avoid committing sensitive information like passwords or API keys directly to the repository.
  - **Why:** This is a major security risk that can lead to unauthorized access.
- **Avoid Large Commits:** Avoid large commits that include multiple unrelated changes.
  - **Why:** Large commits make it harder to review code and track changes. Instead, make each commit small and focused on a single change or feature.

## Conclusion

Best practices for code and repository management involve careful commit message writing, effective use of Github, ensuring PRs and issues are well-documented, and maintaining a robust release management process. Following these practices can help maintain high-quality, maintainable code.

## Tools and Technology

- **[GitHub](https://github.com/):** For development workflow and release management.
  - **Pros:** Widely used, feature-rich, supports collaboration.
  - **Cons:** Can be overwhelming for new users, requires careful configuration.
