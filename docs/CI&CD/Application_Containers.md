# Application Containers: Pratical Practices

This document outlines proven practices for leveraging application containers effectively, based on practical experience in deploying and managing applications efficiently and securely. By adopting these guidelines, you can ensure a smooth, scalable, and secure development process.

## Guidelines

- **Deploy Applications in Containers:** Use containers as the foundation of modern, scalable infrastructure.
- **Follow Consistent Build Guidelines:** Implement well-structured pipelines for better, more predictable results.
- **Select the Right CI/CD Tool:** Choose a CI/CD tool based on your specific needs, with GitHub Actions as a robust option.
- **Ensure High Code Quality:** Use linters and testing tools at every step of the development process.
- **Follow Dockerfile Best Practices:** Create efficient and secure images by adhering to Dockerfile best practices.
- **Implement Container Scanning:** Integrate container scanning into your security measures for early vulnerability detection.
- **Use a Reliable Container Registry:** Opt for a robust and reliable container registry like GCP Container Registry, Azure Container Registry, or IBM Cloud Container Registry.
- **Migrate to Kubernetes:** Migrate applications to a container orchestration solution like Kubernetes (GKE) for scalable deployments.

## Must Do

- **Implement CI/CD Pipeline:** All container builds must be implemented in a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions. This ensures automated linting, testing, and scanning at every commit.
  - **Why:** Automates the build process, enforces code quality, and ensures consistent deployments.
  - **Example:**
    ```yaml
    name: CI/CD Pipeline
    on: [push]
    jobs:
      build:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - uses: actions/checkout@v3
          - name: Lint Dockerfile
            run: hadolint Dockerfile
          - name: Build and Scan
            run: |
              docker build -t my-app .
              trivy image --exit-code 1 --severity HIGH my-app
    ```

- **Adhere to Dockerfile Best Practices:** Follow Dockerfile best practices to create efficient and secure images.
  - **Why:** Improves image size, security, and build consistency.
  - **Practices:**
    - **Use Specific Base Images:** Always specify a versioned base image (e.g., `FROM ubuntu:20.04`) to avoid unexpected changes.
    - **Leverage Multi-Stage Builds:** Use multi-stage builds to separate build tools from runtime dependencies, reducing image size.
    - **Run as Non-Root User:** Add a non-root user and group, and switch to that user to minimize privilege escalation risks.
    - **Remove Unused Packages:** Delete unnecessary packages to keep images lean and reduce the attack surface.
    - **Protect Important Directories:** Ensure that important directories, like `/etc`, are protected during the build process.

- **Use Trivy for Comprehensive Container Scanning:** Implement container scanning using Trivy to detect vulnerabilities in both application and OS packages.
  - **Why:** Identifies potential security risks early in the development process.
  - **Example:**
    ```bash
    trivy image --exit-code 1 --severity HIGH my-app
    ```

- **Migrate to Kubernetes for Production Workloads:** Migrate your apps to a container orchestration solution like Kubernetes (GKE) for production workloads.
  - **Why:** Provides scalability, reliability, and automated management of containerized applications.
  - **Considerations:** Use Helm for managing Kubernetes deployments, configure resource limits, and implement proper networking policies.

## Should Do

- **Use Trivy with Container Registry:** Use Trivy in conjunction with GCP’s Container Registry for added security features.
  - **Why:** Provides continuous vulnerability scanning and compliance checks, enhancing the security posture of your container images.

## Could Do

- **Consider Harbor as Container Registry:** Consider Harbor as your container registry if you need a CNCF-certified registry with advanced features like image replication and role-based access control.
  - **Pros:**
    - CNCF-certified, ensuring community support and standards compliance.
    - Advanced features like image replication, role-based access control, and vulnerability scanning.
  - **Cons:**
    - Requires more setup and maintenance compared to cloud-native registries.
    - May have a steeper learning curve for teams unfamiliar with CNCF projects.

- **Maintain Images with HashiCorp Packer:** If containerization isn’t feasible, maintain Images with regular patches using a CI/CD pipeline and HashiCorp Packer to automate updates.
  - **Pros:**
    - Automates the creation and patching of machine images.
    - Supports multiple platforms and cloud providers.
  - **Cons:**
    - Adds complexity to the image management process.
    - Requires additional configuration and maintenance.

## Won't Do

- **Avoid Exceptions for Non-Containerized Apps:** Avoid making exceptions for apps that can’t be containerized unless absolutely necessary.
  - **Why:** Non-containerized apps are harder to scale, secure, and manage, leading to increased operational overhead.

## Conclusion

Following these proven practices for application containers ensures a well-constructed, secure, and high-performing container environment. This translates to robust, reliable software delivery, fewer headaches, and more time to focus on innovation.
